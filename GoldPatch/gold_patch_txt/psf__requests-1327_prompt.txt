Transport adapters don't work as advertised
Having:

``` python
  >>> import requests
  >>> s = requests.Session()
```

We cannot currently reliably do::

``` python
  >>> import requests_testadapter
  >>> s.mount('http://test.com', requests_testadapter.TestAdapter(b'Mock'))
```

We should, this is documented: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#transport-adapters

Instead, because of [Session.get_adapter()](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/sessions.py#L478) the following might or might not work as expected:

``` python
  >>> s.get('http://test.com')
```

This is because there is already a default adapter for `'http://'` in the form of `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter`. Depending on the (seemingly random) order of keys in the `s.adapters` dictionary, for some combinations of keys it will work, for others it won't.
## Solutions

There are a couple. As usual, a compromise between backwards compatibility, clarity and performance.
### Slow but compatible

Change `Session.get_adapter()` so that it sorts the keys every time it fetches an adapter. The advantage is that `session_obj.adapters` is still a vanilla dictionary, if you consider it a public API.
### A custom dictionary type

Something like Django's `SortedDict` which would sort the keys on insertion. The advantage is that `session_obj.adapters` is still a mapping and now `Session.get_adapter()` is faster. The disadvantage is the maintenance cost of a custom data structure. Also, mild backwards incompatibility if someone somewhere used the fact that `session_obj.adapters` is exactly of the type `dict` (unlikely, isn't it?).
### A list of tuples

Having `Session.mount()` and `Session.get_adapter()` as the public API for adapters, we might just as well implement the sorting while mounting and just maintain `session_obj.adapters` as a list of tuples. The advantage is that it's the fastest solution with no additional maintenance burden. The disadvantage is backwards incompatibility.
## We have to sort... but how exactly?

This is another design issue. It appears that sorting first from the longest key to shortest, and then alphabetically (for keys of the same length), is the way.
## You decide

What should we do about it? By the way, this test adapter in the example above [is an actual thing](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-testadapter).
