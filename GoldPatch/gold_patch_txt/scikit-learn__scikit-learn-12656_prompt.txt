<!--
Example: Fixes #1234. See also #3456.
Please use keywords (e.g., Fixes) to create link to the issues or pull requests
you resolved, so that they will automatically be closed when your pull request

--> Fixes #10580 


#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
Removed the labels parameter in hamming_loss function. Removed all
instances of labels within the method. Since hamming_loss is used
only with mulitlabel input, changed len(labels) to y_true.shape[1].
