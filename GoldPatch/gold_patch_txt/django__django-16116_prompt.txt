makemigrations --check generating migrations is inconsistent with other uses of --check
Description
	
To script a check for missing migrations but without actually intending to create the migrations, it is necessary to use both --check and --dry-run, which is inconsistent with migrate --check and optimizemigration --check, which just exit (after possibly logging a bit).
I'm suggesting that makemigrations --check should just exit without making migrations.
The choice to write the migrations anyway was not discussed AFAICT on ticket:25604 or ​https://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/zczdY6c9KSg/m/ZXCXQsGDDAAJ.
Noticed when reading ​PR to adjust the documentation of migrate --check. I think the current documentation is silent on this question.
