Add support for multiple values for the x-forwarded-proto header
Description
	
When Django is deployed behind more than one proxy, the proxy behavior is sometimes to list the protocol as a comma-separated list. 
However, currently, Django expects only one value for the x-forwarded-proto header, instead of parsing it as a list of values and setting the protocol accordingly.
x-forwarded-proto is a non-standard header, so there isn't a specification for its use, but different reverse-proxy vendors do use it in different ways, and some append the protocol as a comma-separated value from left-to-right (left being the furthermost proxy and rightmost being the closest). 
Similar issues have been raised and implemented in other projects, for example:
Tornado: 
Issue: ​https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/issues/2161
Implementation: ​https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/00c9e0ae31a5a0d12e09109fb77ffe391bfe1131/tornado/httpserver.py#L347-L350
Ruby: 
Issue: ​https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10789
Implemenation: ​https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/d92f09a5eea009fa28cd046e9d0eb698e3d94c5c/tool/lib/webrick/httprequest.rb#L614-L616
Reactor-Netty:
​https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/976
Implementation: ​https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/commit/e190d5bbf65d88d3a0240cd60b81e1ee1907030e
Most implementation use the leftmost-value or rightmost value. I would expect that provided that you are certain that the initial proxy can be trusted, that the left-most value makes the most sense, since it represent the original value at the entry-point for the HTTP request which is often where TLS is being terminated. 
Common example of this behavior is when using mulitple AWS proxies such as API Gateway proxying to an elastic load balancer.
