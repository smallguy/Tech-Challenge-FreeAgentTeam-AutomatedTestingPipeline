Non-deterministic crash in django.db.models.sql.Query.combine()
Description
	
Hi,
There's a logical error somewhere in Query.combine or friends.
I have a pretty complicated query with many-to-many self-joins and ORs, and after the upgrade to Django 1.9 and Python 3 combine() sometimes, but not always, crashes with the assertion error
assert set(change_map.keys()).intersection(set(change_map.values())) == set()
Inspecting the change_map, it does indeed contain a circular reference (BTW shouldn't you use "not" to test for an empty set rather than comparing with set()?).
At first, I didn't understand how it could crash sometimes and sometimes not - we're talking about the same query being executed through a view. But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.
Here comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:
class Invoice(models.Model):
	customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)
	date_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)
	date_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
	date_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
	date_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
	date_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
	date_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
	invoice_type = models.CharField(default="invoice", max_length=32)
	reminders = models.ManyToManyField("Invoice", related_name="reminded_set", blank=True)
	reminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
That's the model, and in the view:
	import datetime
	from django.db.models import Q
	date = datetime.datetime.now()
	invoices = Invoice.objects.filter(
		Q(date_created__lte=date),
		Q(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),
		Q(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),
		customer=1,
	)
	filtered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()
	not_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)
	not_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)
	not_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)
	filtered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type="invoice")
	filtered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type="invoice")
	for r in [1, 2, 3]:
		qs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type="invoice")
		for i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):
			qs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))
		filtered_invoices |= qs
I realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.
