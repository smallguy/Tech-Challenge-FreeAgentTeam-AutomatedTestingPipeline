Issue warning/error if 'testpaths' does not match any files/folders
We should issue a warning (or even an error?) if  `testpaths` does not match any files or folders.

I think an error is reasonable, even if it might break some incorrectly-configured suite out there.

This is not really a bug, but an intended (albeit questionable) behavior: 

The values of `testpaths` are actually globs, so globbing for `tests` in the root yields nothing. Given it finds nothing, pytest will behave as if called from the command-line without any parameters, which makes it search recursively from the current directory looking for `python_files` to collect.

https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/739408b958f8e5a24de81e17e4cc2d4f34d93991/src/_pytest/config/__init__.py#L1382-L1384

If you create the `tests` directory, then pytest will correctly search in that directory only.

I agree those 2 facts are surprising:

1. The fact that `testpaths` is a glob. This is [documented](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#confval-testpaths) but easy to overlook, probably we should add a glob to the example there.
2. pytest silently not finding anything, and then proceeding as usual.

I don't think we can do anything more for 1, but for 2 seems like we should at least emit a warning if `testpaths` is defined but does not match anything.
