Wrong hint about recursive relationship.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)
	 
When there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:
hint=(
	'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
	'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'
But 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.
This was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.
Edit: fixed description.
