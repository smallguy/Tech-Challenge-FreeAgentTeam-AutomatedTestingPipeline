## 原始问题描述
Add a `deselected` parameter to `assert_outcomes()`
<!--
Thanks for suggesting a feature!

Quick check-list while suggesting features:
-->

#### What's the problem this feature will solve?
<!-- What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve with pytest as it currently stands? -->
I'd like to be able to use `pytester.RunResult.assert_outcomes()` to check deselected count.

#### Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->
Add a `deselected` parameter to `pytester.RunResult.assert_outcomes()`

<!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable and how it solves the problem described above. -->
Plugins that use `pytest_collection_modifyitems` to change the `items` and add change the deselected items need to be tested. Using `assert_outcomes()` to check the deselected count would be helpful.

#### Alternative Solutions
<!-- Have you tried to workaround the problem using a pytest plugin or other tools? Or a different approach to solving this issue? Please elaborate here. -->
Use `parseoutcomes()` instead of `assert_outcomes()`. `parseoutcomes()` returns a dictionary that includes `deselected`, if there are any.
However, if we have a series of tests, some that care about deselected, and some that don't, then we may have some tests using `assert_outcomes()` and some using `parseoutcomes()`, which is slightly annoying.

#### Additional context
<!-- Add any other context, links, etc. about the feature here. -->
