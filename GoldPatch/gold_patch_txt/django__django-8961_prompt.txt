## 原始问题描述
Improve program name for Django's command-line utility.
Description
	
By default, according to the ​documentation there are three ways to execute Django's command-line utility:
$ django-admin <command> [options]
$ manage.py <command> [options]
$ python -m django <command> [options]
When executing the help command, however, the way these are rendered may be incorrect:
$ django-admin help
Type 'django-admin help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
...
$ ./manage.py help
Type 'manage.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
...
$ python -m django help
Type '__main__.py help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.
...
It should also be noted that manage.py will typically not work and ./manage.py is required:
$ manage.py help
bash: manage.py: command not found
On Windows it will work, but only if the file type is associated with the Python interpreter and not an editor.
So, the issues here are:
__main__.py should be replaced by python -m django (or possibly use os.path.basename(sys.executable))
Should manage.py be replaced with ./manage.py on non-Windows platforms? What about Windows?
What should happen with the manage.py option in the documentation?
