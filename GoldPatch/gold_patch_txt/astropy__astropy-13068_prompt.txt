Time from astropy.time not precise
Hello,

I encounter difficulties with Time. I'm working on a package to perform photometry and occultation. 

For this last case, data need times values accurately estimated. Of course, data coming from different camera will will have different time format in the header.

to manage this without passing long time to build a time parser, i decided to use Time object which do exactly what i need. The problem is, i dont arrive to make accurate conversion between different format using Time.

let's do an exemple:

```
t1 = '2022-03-24T23:13:41.390999'
t1 = Time(t1, format = 'isot', precision = len(t1.split('.')[-1]))
t2 = t1.to_value('jd')
# result is 2459663.4678401737
```
now let's do reverse

```
t2 = Time(t2, format = 'jd', precision = len(str(t2).split('.')[-1]))
t3 = t2.to_value('isot')
# result is 2022-03-24T23:13:41.0551352177
```
as you can see i don't fall back on the same value and the difference is quite high. I would like to fall back on the original one.

thank you in advance
