The negative score is not very beginner friendly
For the past months I've been under the impression that the negative score is not very friendly for beginners. It somewhat demotivating to run `pylint` over your project just to get a `-24/10.0` as a score, which would make `pylint` look like a super drastic tool, that's super nitpicky about everything.

I think we could do a better job here at welcoming everyone to using `pylint`. Instead of having a `0-10` score, we could check if other tools are doing something different and see what works best in general.
