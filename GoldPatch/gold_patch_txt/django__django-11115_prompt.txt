Make it easier to track down the offending models for AlreadyRegistered exceptions
Description
	
I've just updated 20+ packages locally in a project's requirements file, one of which has caused:
[2016-10-18 15:00:18,667] ERROR [django.request:256] Internal Server Error: /browserid/csrf/
Traceback (most recent call last):

AlreadyRegistered: The model Site is already registered
This model isn't defined in the project's own models so in this particular case it must be django-browserid now clashing with one of the packages that was updated.
Rather than having to bisect, it would be much more helpful if this exception gave more details about the already-registered model, so I know which package/app is clashing with the later app's attempts to re-register it.
