More customization options for figure_language_filename for localized images
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm working on the localization of the [Godot Engine documentation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs), and we use a [separate repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs-l10n) to hold the massive PO files that we use for Weblate and Sphinx.

I'm now working on image localization ([upstream issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs-l10n/issues/5)) and I find that even though [`figure_language_filename`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-figure_language_filename) seems to provide some customization option, it's impossible to host the localized images in the separate repository.

Indeed, both the `{root}` and `{path}` substitution tokens resolve to absolute paths from the host system (e.g. `root: /home/akien/Projects/godot/godot-docs-l10n/docs/tutorials/shading/img/vs_popup`), and since I can't do post-processing of the subsituted string, I can't strip the `/home/akien/Projects/godot/godot-docs-l10n/docs/` base path to attempt using something like `../img/{language}/{rel_path}/{filename}{ext}`.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like the addition of one or more new path substitution tokens that can be used to customize the path to localized images more freely.

For example, for this structure:
```
foo/bar/index.rst
foo/bar/img/image.png
```
and `index.rst` referencing `.. image:: img/image.png`, I could imagine two useful substitution tokens:
```
relative_path = "img/"
resolved_path = "foo/bar/img/"
```

Alternatively (and possible as a better solution), `{root}` and `{path}` could be changed to actually be relative to the Sphinx project's root folder, i.e. the `{resolved_path}` in my example above, i.e.:
```
root = "foo/bar/img/image"
path = "foo/bar/img"
```
(While the documentation currently states that these would be `img/image` and `img/`, which is wrong in my tests on Linux with Sphinx 1.8.5).

I don't specifically need access to the file-relative path `img/` in my use case, but I imagine that some projects may benefit from it.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I don't see any alternative option that would enable the workflow I want to use with localized images not being either in the original image's folder, or in one of its subfolders.

*Edit:* We came up with ~two~ three hacks that we could use to workaround the currently limited substitution tokens offered by `figure_language_filename`:
- Passing a class that redefines `format()` with our custom post-processing: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs-l10n/issues/5#issuecomment-637569033
- Symlinking all localized images from the out-of-tree location to the in-tree location where Sphinx wants it: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs-l10n/issues/5#issuecomment-637572793
- Overriding sphinx.util.i18n.get_image_filename_for_language since apparently Python lets us do that, so we can do the post-processing we want: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs-l10n/issues/5#issuecomment-637589503

I did not test with latest Sphinx as it's not properly supported on ReadTheDocs yet, but the relevant code seems to be unchanged from 1.8.5:
https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/3.x/sphinx/util/i18n.py#L299-L315
