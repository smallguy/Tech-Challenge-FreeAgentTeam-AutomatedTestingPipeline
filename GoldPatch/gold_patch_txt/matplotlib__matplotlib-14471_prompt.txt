Existing FigureCanvasQT objects destroyed by call to plt.figure
### Bug report

**Bug summary**

For a number of years, I have been maintaining an interactive application that embeds subclassed FigureCanvasQT objects within a PyQt application. Up until Matplotlib v3.0.3., it was possible to create standard Matplotlib PyQt figures, i.e., using `plt.figure` within an embedded IPython shell, that coexist with the subclassed canvas objects. Now in Matplotlib v3.1.0, a call to `plt.figure()` destroys all the other canvas objects. 

Unfortunately, I cannot debug this within Visual Studio since I am currently unable to install Matplotlib from the source. By going through the `new_figure_manager` code line by line, I can confirm that the windows are destroyed when calling `FigureCanvasQT.__init__(figure)`, but not when calling `FigureCanvasBase.__init__(figure)`, but I can't work out what triggers the destruction of the other windows. I presume the subclassed canvasses are not being registered somewhere, and `pyplot` assumes they are no longer active, but I am hoping someone will show me where to look. This may not be a Matplotlib bug, but it's certainly an unwelcome side effect in my application.

**Code for reproduction**
If you have `nexpy` installed (`pip install nexpy`) and launch it, you can reproduce this from within the embedded IPython shell with the following, which creates a new subclassed window and then attempts to open a regular `pyplot` window.:

```
In [1]: new_window=NXPlotView()
In [2]: plt.get_fignums()
Out[2]: [1, 2]
In [3]: plt.figure()
```
There are two figure numbers, because NeXpy automatically creates a window with a figure number of 1 when it is launched.

**Actual outcome**

A new window with an updated figure number is created but all other windows not created by `pyplot`  are destroyed.

```
In [4]: plt.get_fignums()
Out[4]: [3]
```

**Expected outcome**

In Matplotlib v3.0.3, a new `pyplot` window is created by the PyQt5 backend without destroying anything else.

```
In [4]: plt.get_fignums()
Out[4]: [1, 2, 3]
```
