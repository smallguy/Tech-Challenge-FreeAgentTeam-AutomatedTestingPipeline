migrate --check still emits signals if database is up to date
Description
	 
		(last modified by Jacob Walls)
	 
pre_migrate and post_migrate signals are emitted for migrate --check, but only if the database is up-to-date.
A related side effect is that the logs also look like a like a real run, as it says "Operations to perform:" and "Running migrations:". The last sentence clarifies that nothing has been applied, but there is still the potential for a half-second of "what have I just done?".
% python manage.py migrate --check		 
Operations to perform:
 Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, social_django
Running migrations:
 No migrations to apply.
