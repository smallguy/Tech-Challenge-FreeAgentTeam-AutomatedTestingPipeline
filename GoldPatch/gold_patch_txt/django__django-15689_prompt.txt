APPEND_SLASH adds significant latency to all requests not ending in / (even if successful)
Description
	
Originally, APPEND_SLASH worked by looking for 404 responses and replacing them with redirects, so as not to unnecessarily impact the performance of successful responses. However, commit 9390da7fb6e251eaa9a785692f987296cb14523f in 1.9.5/1.10 changed this to check should_redirect_with_slash() on every request, resulting in a moderately expensive extra urlconf lookup for every request not ending with /, whether or not it succeeds as written.
This performance impact was not considered in the commit message or the corresponding ticket #26293, so I assume it was an oversight. That ticket asserted “This doesn't really make sense, since the two settings are not interdependent”, which is incorrect—performance was the reason for the interdependence.
The overhead was found to be significant enough in Zulip to merit ​subclassing CommonMiddleware to skip it in certain conditions.
Here’s a ​minimal test project with an exaggerated number of routes so the overhead can be easily observed.
