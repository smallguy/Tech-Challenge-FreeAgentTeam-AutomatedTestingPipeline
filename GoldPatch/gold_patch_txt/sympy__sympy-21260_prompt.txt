Same symbols created in different processes are not resolved as being equal
Hello,

When I try to create symbols (and by extension expressions) in different processes, SymPy somehow does not detect that the symbols are the same even though they have the same name and assumptions.

As an example, consider the following code snippet and the respective output:

```
import multiprocessing as mp
import sympy as sp

VAR_X = sp.Symbol('x', real=True, nonzero=True)

def process():
    return sp.Symbol('x', real=True, nonzero=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a1 = sp.Symbol('a', real=True, nonzero=True)
    a2 = sp.Symbol('a', real=True, nonzero=True)
    print(a1, a2, a1 == a2, a1 - a2, '\n')

    pool = mp.Pool(4)
    jobs = []
    for _ in range(5):
        jobs.append(pool.apply_async(process))
    symbols = []
    for job in jobs:
        symbols.append(job.get())
    pool.close()

    for s in symbols:
        print(s, ' | ', VAR_X, ' | ', s - VAR_X, ' | ', sp.simplify(s - VAR_X))
```

Output:
```
a a True 0

x  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x
x  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x
x  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x
x  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x
x  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x
```

@oscarbenjamin thinks this may be related to pickling and unpickling the symbol. Working in the same process creating two different symbols returns the
exact same object:
```
In [5]: x1 = Symbol('x')

In [6]: x2 = Symbol('x')

In [7]: x1 is x2
Out[7]: True
```

I also tried to explicitly pickle and unpickle the symbols using the `dill` library, but this also didn't help.

Interestingly, if I obtain two expressions (separately) from different processes, and one is integrand `f` and the other is expected integral `F` (both containing only one free symbol, `x`), SymPy manages to resolve that `simplify(F.diff() - f) == 0` and `simplify(integrate(f) - F) == 0`. Note that I **do not** pass the symbol `x` with respect to which to differentiate or integrate. If I do it, it fails. Unfortunately, I don't have a small enough code snippet readily prepared to exemplify this behaviour.
