Added message when user mispells 'urlpatterns' in some 'urls' module
Description
	
I found this kind of error when I mispelled urlspattern instead of urlpatterns inside my blog/urls.py file.
So the console was throwing an error, but this error do not helped me to found the problem. Check it:
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: The included URLconf '<module 'blog.urls'
from '.../my_project/blog/urls.py'>' does not
 appear to have any patterns in it. If you see valid patterns in the file then the
 issue is probably caused by a circular import.
The problem is not with a circular import, but with the mispelled urlpatterns variable itself, so I'm doing this ticket. 
OBS.: I have already created a pull request for this: ​https://github.com/django/django/pull/14453
I appreciate any feedback.
Thanks,
Igor
